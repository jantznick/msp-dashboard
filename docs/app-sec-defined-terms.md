# Glossary of AppSec Terms

## Common Terminology in Application Security

This page provides definitions for common terms you will encounter when working with the AppSec team and our tools.

### A-F

**Application Security (AppSec)**
: The practice of finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities at the application layer, spanning the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
: A type of injection vulnerability where a malicious script is injected into a trusted website. It allows an attacker to execute scripts in the victim's browser, which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

**DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
: A method of testing an application in its running state. DAST tools simulate attacks against a live application to find vulnerabilities that are only detectable when the code is executing.

### G-P

**Least Privilege, Principle of**
: A security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform their job functions.

**OWASP Top 10**
: A standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

### Q-Z

**SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
: A method of testing an application by examining its source code or compiled binaries without executing the program. SAST is used to find vulnerabilities early in the SDLC.

**SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**
: The process of automatically identifying the open-source software in a codebase. This analysis is performed to evaluate security, license compliance, and code quality.

**SQL Injection (SQLi)**
: A type of injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve.

**Threat Modeling**
: A process for identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle and devising appropriate mitigations.
