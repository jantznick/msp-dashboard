# Domain Monitoring

## Proactive Defense for Your Online Presence

In today's digital landscape, your application's domain is a primary target for malicious actors. Domain monitoring is a critical service we provide to proactively detect and respond to threats like phishing sites, typosquatting, and brand impersonation.

### What We Monitor

Our domain monitoring service continuously scans the internet for:

-   **Newly Registered Domains:** We look for domains that are confusingly similar to ours, which could be used to trick employees or customers.
-   **SSL Certificate Transparency Logs:** We monitor for SSL certificates issued for domains that might be impersonating our brands.
-   **Phishing Databases:** We check known phishing feeds for any campaigns that might be targeting our domains.

### How It Works

1.  **Automated Scanning:** Our systems are constantly monitoring for suspicious activity related to our domains.
2.  **Alerting & Triage:** When a potential threat is identified, an alert is sent to the AppSec team for immediate investigation.
3.  **Takedown & Remediation:** If a threat is confirmed, we initiate a takedown process with the relevant hosting provider or registrar and take steps to mitigate any potential impact.

### Requesting Monitoring

All new applications onboarded through our intake process are automatically added to our monitoring service. If you have an existing application or domain that you would like to ensure is covered, please contact the AppSec team.
