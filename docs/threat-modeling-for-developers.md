# Threat Modeling for Developers

## Thinking Like an Attacker to Build Better Defenses

Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations early in the development lifecycle. By thinking about what could go wrong before you write a single line of code, you can build more secure, resilient applications from the start.

### Why Threat Model?

-   **Find Flaws Early:** It's exponentially cheaper and faster to fix a security flaw on the whiteboard than in production.
-   **Improve System Design:** Threat modeling forces you to think critically about your application's architecture, data flows, and trust boundaries.
-   **Prioritize Security Efforts:** It helps you identify the most critical parts of your application and focus your security efforts where they matter most.
-   **Build Security In, Not Bolt It On:** It makes security a fundamental part of the design process, rather than an afterthought.

### Our Threat Modeling Process (STRIDE)

We encourage a lightweight, developer-led threat modeling process based on the STRIDE framework:

-   **S**poofing: Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user or component?
-   **T**ampering: Can an attacker modify data in transit or at rest?
-   **R**epudiation: Can a user deny having performed an action?
-   **I**nformation Disclosure: Can an attacker gain access to sensitive information?
-   **D**enial of Service: Can an attacker prevent legitimate users from accessing the system?
-   **E**levation of Privilege: Can an attacker gain capabilities they should not have?

### Getting Started

1.  **Diagram Your System:** Create a simple data flow diagram (DFD) showing the main components, data stores, and trust boundaries.
2.  **Identify Threats:** For each component and data flow, brainstorm potential threats using the STRIDE model.
3.  **Propose Mitigations:** For each identified threat, determine what controls or design changes are needed to mitigate it.
4.  **Review & Document:** The AppSec team is here to help. We can facilitate threat modeling sessions, review your models, and provide expert guidance.

We offer regular training sessions on threat modeling. Please check the company training calendar or contact the AppSec team to learn more.
