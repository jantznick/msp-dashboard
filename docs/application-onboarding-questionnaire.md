# Application Onboarding Questionnaire

## Registering Your Application with the AppSec Program

The Application Onboarding Questionnaire is the official process for registering a new or existing application with the AppSec program. This form gathers the essential technical and business context we need to provide you with the right security tools and services.

### Why is this Necessary?

Each application is unique. This form provides us with the specific details required to:

-   **Integrate Security Tools:** We need to know your source code repository, build process, and hosting environment to correctly configure automated scanning (SAST, SCA).
-   **Scope Security Assessments:** The information you provide helps us understand the application's architecture, data sensitivity, and attack surface, which is crucial for effective threat modeling and penetration testing.
-   **Maintain an Accurate Inventory:** This process ensures we have an up-to-date catalog of all applications, their owners, and their security posture.

### The Process

1.  **Complete the Form:** The application owner or a technical lead should fill out the questionnaire with as much detail as possible.
2.  **Automated Tool Integration:** Upon submission, our systems will automatically attempt to set up SAST and SCA scanning for the repository you provided.
3.  **Onboarding Review:** The AppSec team will review your submission and schedule a brief follow-up meeting to confirm the details and discuss the next steps in your security roadmap.
