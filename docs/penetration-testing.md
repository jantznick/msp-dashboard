# Penetration Testing Services

## Uncover and Remediate Vulnerabilities Before Attackers Do

A penetration test, or pen test, is an authorized, simulated cyberattack on an application or system to evaluate its security. Our team conducts in-depth penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.

### Our Approach

We view penetration testing as a collaborative effort between the AppSec team and the application owners. Our goal is not just to find flaws, but to help you understand the root cause and strengthen your application's defenses for the long term.

Our methodology typically includes:

1.  **Scoping & Rules of Engagement:** We work with you to define the scope of the test, what is allowed, and what is off-limits.
2.  **Information Gathering:** We collect information about the target to understand its architecture and potential attack vectors.
3.  **Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Analysis:** We identify potential threats and analyze the application for known and unknown vulnerabilities.
4.  **Exploitation:** We attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to determine the potential impact.
5.  **Reporting & Remediation:** We provide a detailed report of our findings, including risk ratings and clear, actionable steps for remediation. We then work with you to track remediation efforts.
