# New Customer Roadmap

## Your Journey to Enhanced Application Security

Welcome to the AppSec program! We've designed a clear and straightforward onboarding process to get you started. This roadmap outlines the typical journey for a new team or company engaging with our services.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Onboarding (Weeks 1-2)

1.  **Initial Contact & Scoping:** It all starts with a conversation to understand your team, your applications, and your goals.
2.  **Complete Posture Analysis:** Your Engineering Manager completes the [Posture Analysis Questionnaire](/docs/posture-analysis-questionnaire) to give us a baseline understanding of your current practices.
3.  **Onboarding Meeting:** We'll meet to review your questionnaire, answer your questions, and introduce you to the AppSec team and our services.
4.  **Initial Roadmap Development:** Based on our conversation, we will draft an initial security roadmap with prioritized activities for the first quarter.

### Phase 2: Integration & Initial Services (Weeks 3-6)

1.  **Tool Integration:** We will work with you to integrate our automated security scanning tools (SAST, SCA) into your CI/CD pipelines.
2.  **First Application Onboarding:** We'll guide you through the process of onboarding your first application using the [Application Onboarding Questionnaire](/docs/application-onboarding-questionnaire).
3.  **Developer Training:** We will provide access to our threat modeling and secure coding training materials for your development team.

### Phase 3: Maturing & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

1.  **Regular Cadence Meetings:** We will establish a regular meeting schedule to review scan results, discuss upcoming changes, and provide ongoing security guidance.
2.  **Penetration Testing:** Once your application is ready, we will schedule and conduct a full penetration test.
3.  **SAMM Assessment:** After approximately six months, we will conduct a SAMM assessment to measure the maturity of your security practices and identify areas for future improvement.

This roadmap is a general guide. We will work with you to tailor the plan to your specific needs and priorities.
