# Our Capabilities & Tools

## A Suite of Tools to Secure the SDLC

We provide a range of industry-leading security tools that integrate directly into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Our goal is to provide developers with fast, accurate feedback so you can find and fix vulnerabilities as early as possible.

### Code & Dependency Scanning

**[Snyk](/products/snyk)** is our primary tool for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA). It is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and automatically scans your code on every pull request to:

-   Find and fix security vulnerabilities in your own code.
-   Detect known vulnerabilities in your open-source dependencies.
-   Ensure license compliance for third-party libraries.

### Web Application & API Scanning

For Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), we leverage **[Tenable WAS](/products/tenable-was)**. This tool tests a running application by simulating attacks to find runtime vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss. We typically run DAST scans in staging environments prior to a major release.

### Advanced API Security

**[Traceable API Security](/products/traceable-api-security)** provides end-to-end protection for your APIs. It helps discover all of your APIs, protects them from malicious traffic and business logic abuse, and provides rich context to help remediate vulnerabilities.

### Edge Protection

Our primary Web Application Firewall (WAF) is **[Fastly NGWAF](/products/fastly-ngwaf)**. It provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable defense at the edge, protecting your applications and APIs from a wide range of threats before they can reach your infrastructure.

### How to Get Access

When you onboard a new application, we will work with you to configure Snyk scanning for your repository. Other tools can be requested on a case-by-case basis. To make a request, please use the [Request a Tool form](/request).
