# SAMM Assessments

## Measuring and Improving Your Security Maturity

SAMM, which stands for the Software Assurance Maturity Model, is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to their specific business risks. We use SAMM to help you measure the maturity of your security practices, identify gaps, and create a data-driven roadmap for improvement.

### How SAMM Works

SAMM defines five key business functions related to software development:

-   **Governance:** How strategy, policies, and compliance are managed.
-   **Design:** How security is considered in the architecture and design phase.
-   **Implementation:** How secure coding practices are followed and vulnerabilities are avoided.
-   **Verification:** How security is tested and verified throughout the lifecycle.
-   **Operations:** How security is managed in the production environment.

Within each of these functions, SAMM defines several security practices. We assess your team's adoption and proficiency in each practice, assigning a maturity level from 0 (unaware) to 3 (mastery).

### The Assessment Process

1.  **Interviews & Evidence Collection:** The AppSec team will conduct a series of interviews with key stakeholders, including developers, architects, and product managers. We will also review relevant documentation and processes.
2.  **Scoring & Analysis:** We score your practices against the SAMM framework and analyze the results to identify strengths and weaknesses.
3.  **Roadmap Workshop:** We present our findings in a collaborative workshop and work with you to create a phased, achievable roadmap for improving your security maturity over the next 6-12 months.

A SAMM assessment is not an audit; it's a collaborative tool for continuous improvement. Our goal is to provide you with the insights you need to build a sustainable and effective security program.
