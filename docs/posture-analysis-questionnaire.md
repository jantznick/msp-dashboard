# Posture Analysis Questionnaire

## Establishing Your Security Baseline

The Posture Analysis Questionnaire is a critical first step for teams and companies engaging with the AppSec program for the first time. This questionnaire helps us understand your existing development practices, operational environments, and security controls.

### Why is this Necessary?

By completing this form, you provide us with the foundational knowledge needed to:

-   **Tailor Our Services:** We can recommend the most relevant and impactful security services based on your specific needs.
-   **Establish a Baseline:** The questionnaire provides a snapshot of your current security posture, which we can use to measure improvement over time.
-   **Identify Quick Wins:** We can often identify immediate opportunities to improve security with minimal effort based on your responses.

### The Process

1.  **Complete the Form:** The designated Engineering Manager or technical lead should fill out the questionnaire with as much detail as possible.
2.  **Initial Review:** The AppSec team will review your submission to understand your environment.
3.  **Roadmap Session:** We will schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss your submission and collaboratively develop a security roadmap.
