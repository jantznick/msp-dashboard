### Developer-First Security Platform

Snyk empowers developers to build securely from the start. Our platform integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows, finding and fixing vulnerabilities in your code, open source dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Find and fix security issues in your own code in real-time.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies.
- **Container Security**: Secure your container images and Kubernetes applications from development to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**: Find and fix misconfigurations in your Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes files.

By embedding security into the development process, Snyk helps you accelerate development, reduce risk, and build more secure applications without slowing down.
